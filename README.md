# HyperTrack Live
[![Slack Status](http://slack.hypertrack.com/badge.svg)](http://slack.hypertrack.com)

Share your live location with family and friends and let them share their location back with you.

[![Live Tracking Demo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/296864/25905314/5382bb02-3567-11e7-8403-556353e0c834.gif)

### Live location
Let your friends and family track you on a map when you are on the way. No more phone calls asking where you are.

### Accurate ETA
Send your real-time ETA to your friends and family based on mode of transport and trip progress.

### Easy to share
Use your favorite messaging app to send ETA with a web link for live tracking.

### Private and secure
Your location and trips are completely private and secure. They are shared only with people you chose and only for the duration of the trip.
